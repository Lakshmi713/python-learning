# Python Learning

I created this repository to upload my daily Python practice.  
I am in the process of learning Python step-by-step and improving my basics.  
This will help me later for Data Science, Machine Learning, and placements.

## What I am learning
- Python basics
- Data types and operators
- If-else conditions
- For and while loops
- Strings and their functions
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Functions
- File handling
- Error handling
- OOP basics

## Why I am doing this
I want to become strong in Python,machine learning and build a good base for future subjects and projects.  
This repository helps me track my daily practice and my progress.

## Daily Uploads
I will upload simple Python programs every day as I learn new topics.

## Notes
This repo is mainly for my practice.  
I will keep updating it regularly as I continue learning.
